# Purpose of this code is to begin GBS analysis for Reneth

# Data are located here:
# /home/jkimball/data_release/umgc/nextseq/200302_NB551164_0221_AHLY3CBGXC/Kimball_Project_004

# Load R
module load R/3.6.0

# Write file names to a text file
ls /home/jkimball/data_release/umgc/nextseq/200302_NB551164_0221_AHLY3CBGXC/Kimball_Project_004/*fastq.gz  > 200410_reneth_gbs_sample_names_and_numbers.txt

# For loop makes symlinks
for i in $(cat 200410_reneth_gbs_sample_names_and_numbers.txt); do
ln -s $i .
done

### Open R

# Read in data using the data.table package
library(data.table)
fread("200410_reneth_gbs_sample_names_and_numbers.txt", header=F) -> x

setnames(x, "filename")

x[, sample_number := filename]
# Strip off first part of filename until sample number begins (S) but do not include it.
x[, sample_number := sub("^.+[S]", "", sample_number)]
# Strip off end of the filename (after the sample number) ... begins with "_R1"
x[, sample_number := sub("_[R1].+$", "", sample_number)]

# Convert sample numbers to numerical and add leading zeros to all samples (to help with sorting).
x[, sample_number := sprintf("%04d", as.numeric(sample_number))]

# Reorder rows in ascending order
x[order(sample_number)] -> x

# Set column order (my personal preference for sample_number to come first)
setcolorder(x, c("sample_number", "filename")) -> x

# Write output to CSV
write.csv(x, file="200410_reneth_GBS_sample_names_and_numbers.csv", row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE, sep=",", quote=FALSE)
# This still wrote a header line to the CSV file. It needs to be removed for the directory setup to work properly

### Go back to command line

# Set up directory structure
cat 200410_reneth_GBS_sample_names_and_numbers.csv | cut -f 1 -d , \
	| while read i; do
	d=Sample_$i
	echo $i
	mkdir -p $d
	done

# Delete directory that comes from sample_name (header) from the csv file
rmdir Sample_sample_number

# Matthew's GBS samples started at #1, but Reneth's samples started at # 125, so this was changed here to reflect that.
# Otherwise, this code will unsuccessfully try to make symlinks for Samples 0001 through 0058--which of course don't exist.
n=$(printf "%04d\n" "$((125))")
cat 200410_reneth_GBS_sample_names_and_numbers.csv | cut -f 2 -d , \
	| while read i; do
	ln -s ${i} Sample_$n/Sample_${n}.fq.gz
	n=$(printf "%04d\n" "$((10#$n+1))")
	done

# Check that the paths are accurate.
